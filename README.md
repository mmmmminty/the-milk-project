# The Milk Project
A COMP6441/6841 Project to help reduce the error-rate of misfeeding babies expressed breastmilk (EBM) at the Royal Hospital for Women in Sydney.

## Tech Stack
The frontend is written in HTML/JavaScript with CSS styling, with the backend written in Python connecting to a PostgreSQL database. 

## Report
The culmination of this project is a report to be presented to the Royal Hospital for Women, in the style of a security audit. This is after 10 weeks of extensive research and communication with nurses at the hospital.

## DISCLAIMER
This is a WIP *student* project. The primary purpose of this repository currently is to provide a technical demonstration (a proof-of-concept) and illustrate the potential benefits of a centralised EBM tracking system.
